                <h1>about clarissa xue</h1>
                <p>I am a 3rd year Human-Centered Computing (HCC) student at Rochester Institute
                    of Technology with a minor in Mathematics. I was previously a Computer Engineering 
                    student and just recently switched into HCC because I wanted to pursue a degree that was more people-oriented
                    and creative. I hope to improve people's experiences with technology by concentrating 
                    in Natural Language Processing to help people create more meaningful and relevant content or products for users.
                <p>
                    The purpose of this site is to present to recruiters, employers, or any interested persons
                    my professional skills and experiences.
